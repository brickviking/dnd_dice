# Python DND Dice Roller
Roll up to 100 dice with sides of 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 20 and 100. These are prevalent especially in Dungeons and Dragons. Only one dice type can be rolled at a time.

# Installation and execution
Simply copy this to a directory in your PATH, and make it executable. This (currently) will only run within a terminal of some sort.

python3 dnd.py numDice numSides

### Sample Output
python3 dnd.py 4 12  
4d12: 1:2 2:5 3:2 4:7 Total of 16/48
